      <h2 class="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50">Why This Page Exists</h2>

      <p>
        This page exists because puzzle players don't want to navigate a maze to find the answer they're looking for. You already know which game you play — you just need the answer, or at most a few hints before the answer. This grid gives you 25 games on one screen, each linking directly to its answer-today page. One click and you're there.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        Most puzzle answer sites bury the actual answer under paragraphs of keyword-stuffed text and pop-up ads. WordSolverX puts the answer at the top of each page. Scroll down if you want context and strategy tips — but you never have to. The answer is right there, the moment the page loads.
      

      </p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50">How Daily Puzzle Answers Work</h2>

      <p>
        Every game on this page operates on a daily cycle. At a specific time each day (usually midnight in a specific time zone), the game resets with a new puzzle. Wordle resets at midnight Eastern time. Betweenle resets at a different time based on its own puzzle window. Nerdle, Quordle, Phoodle — each one has its own schedule.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        WordSolverX tracks all of these schedules. The date you see displayed on this page — {todayStr} — reflects the current puzzle date based on Wordle's window. Other games may show slightly different dates depending on their reset times, but the answer-today pages all account for this automatically. You don't need to worry about time zones or puzzle windows. Just open the page and the correct answer for the current puzzle loads.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        The answer data comes from each game's own source files. For Wordle, that's the official answer list embedded in the game's JavaScript. For Nerdle, it's the equation database. For geography games, it's the country selection algorithm. We decode this data and present it in a readable format, with puzzle numbers and dates so you can verify what you're looking at.
      

      </p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50">Wordle Answer Today</h2>

      <p>
        Wordle is the reason most people end up here, so let's talk about it specifically. The Wordle answer today page shows the five-letter word, the puzzle number (which has been running since June 19, 2021 — puzzle #1 was "cigar"), and a progressive hint system if you want to try solving it yourself before seeing the full word.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        Hints work in three tiers. First, a broad category clue — something like "a common household item" or "a verb you'd use at work." Second, two letter positions are revealed (but not which positions they occupy). Third, the full word. You can stop at any tier. If you just wanted to confirm a letter you were stuck on, the second tier might be enough.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wordle answer list is fixed — the game cycles through a fixed sequence of words. That means our answer is always correct, always in sync with the official game. There's no guessing, no scraping, no room for error. If Wordle says the answer for puzzle #1247 is "FLAME," that's exactly what our page shows.
      

      </p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50">Quordle, Octordle, and Multi-Board Puzzles</h2>

      <p>
        Multi-board puzzles are where daily answers get interesting because you're not just looking for one word — you're looking for four (Quordle) or eight (Octordle). Our answer pages show all words at once, which saves you from opening multiple tabs or scrolling through social media spoilers.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        Quordle gives you nine guesses to solve four five-letter words simultaneously. The strategy page covers this in detail, but the short version is: spread information early, solve individual boards late. If you're stuck, the Quordle solver tool lets you enter clues from all four boards and get suggestions that work across multiple puzzles.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        Quordle answers are determined by a fixed puzzle number sequence. Two players on the same day will always get the same four words. Our answer page includes the puzzle number and date so you can cross-reference if needed.
      

      </p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50">Nerdle, Mathle, and Number Puzzles</h2>

      <p>
        Nerdle replaced the word-guessing mechanic with equation-guessing. You have six guesses to find an eight-character math equation (in Classic mode). The answer page shows the equation, the puzzle number, and a brief note about what makes that particular equation interesting — unusual operations, repeated digits, or tricky syntax.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        Nerdle also has modes beyond Classic: Mini (six characters), Micro (five characters), and Maxi (ten characters). Each mode gets its own daily answer, and our page shows all of them. The Nerdle solver tool handles every mode — you tell it which mode you're playing, enter your guesses, and it filters the equation list accordingly.
      

      </p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50">Geography and Trivia Games</h2>

      <p>
        Worldle, Globle, and Countryle all ask you to identify a country, but they do it differently. Worldle shows you a country silhouette and tells you how far your guess is from the answer. Globle gives you a heat map after each guess showing proximity. Countryle provides standard Wordle-like feedback on attributes like continent, hemisphere, and population.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        The answer pages for these games show the country name, basic stats (capital, continent, population), and a link to a map. It's faster than opening Google Maps and more reliable than asking your group chat. The Countryle solver and Worldle solver let you work through the clues step by step if you'd rather solve than just read the answer.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        Framed and Spotle follow a similar pattern but with different subjects — movies and music artists respectively. Framed shows you stills from a film and you guess the title. Spotle plays clips from an artist's top songs and you identify the musician. Both answer pages include the name, release year (for Framed), or top tracks (for Spotle).
      

      </p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50">Character Guessing Games</h2>

      <p>
        The "-dle" family of character guessing games is surprisingly large. LoLdle covers League of Legends champions. Pokedle covers Pokemon. Narutodle covers Naruto characters. Smashdle covers Super Smash Bros. fighters. Dotadle covers Dota 2 heroes. Onepiecedle covers One Piece characters. Each game gives you a set of clues about the character — appearance, abilities, stats, or voice lines — and you narrow it down from there.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        These games are harder to solve with pure logic because the answer spaces are enormous (there are over 1,000 Pokemon, for example). That's why the answer pages are useful — after three or four guesses of elimination, sometimes you just want to know who it is. The solver tools for these games let you filter by specific attributes (type for Pokedle, role for LoLdle, weight class for Smashdle) so you can at least narrow the field before giving up.
      

      </p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50">Semantic and Unusual Puzzles</h2>

      <p>
        Semantle and Contexto are the oddballs on this page. Instead of letter-based clues, they use semantic similarity — how close your guess is in meaning to the answer, scored on a scale. A guess of "happy" for an answer of "joyful" would score very high. A guess of "zebra" would score very low.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        These games are genuinely difficult because the scoring is opaque. The answer page tells you the word, but more importantly it explains why certain words score high or low. This context is more useful than the raw answer because it helps you understand how the model thinks, which makes future puzzles easier.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        Searchle works similarly but with Google autocomplete. You see a search prompt and try to guess what Google would auto-suggest. It's less about vocabulary and more about understanding how people search. The answer page shows the full autocomplete suggestion and the search volume context.
      

      </p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50">Using the Answer Pages Responsibly</h2>

      <p>
        There's no moral high ground here — some people want the answer immediately, some want hints, some want to solve it themselves and only check at the end. All three approaches are valid. The pages are designed to support all of them.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to avoid spoilers entirely, don't open the page. If you want a nudge, use the hint system where available. If you're completely stuck and the puzzle is ruining your morning, just read the answer and move on. The puzzle will be back tomorrow with a new one.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        For players who treat these games as learning opportunities rather than daily tests, the answer pages paired with the solver tools create a feedback loop. See the answer, understand why you didn't get it, adjust your strategy for tomorrow. Over time, your average guesses will drop and your streak will grow.
      

      </p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50">What Happens When You Miss a Day</h2>

      <p>
        Daily puzzles don't disappear — they just move to the archive. Every game on this page that has archive data gets a dedicated archive page linked from its answer-today page. You can look up what the Wordle answer was on any date going back to June 2021, or check that Phoodle answer from last week you forgot to note down.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        The archive hub page is linked in the navigation above. It lists all supported archives in one place with date pickers and puzzle number references. If you're verifying a streak or settling a debate, that's where to go.
