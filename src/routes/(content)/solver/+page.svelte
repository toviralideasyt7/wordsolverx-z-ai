    {
      question: 'How do puzzle solvers work?',
      answer: 'Our solvers use word frequency data and elimination algorithms to narrow down possible answers. You enter the letters you\'ve guessed and the colors you got back, and the solver filters its word list to show only words that match your clues. It\'s like having a super-powered process of elimination.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Are these solvers free to use?',
      answer: 'Yes, every solver on this page is completely free. No sign-up required, no limits on how many times you can use them. Just pick a solver and start getting help with your puzzle.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Which solver should I use for regular Wordle?',
      answer: 'Use the 5-Letter Wordle Solver for standard Wordle. If you play custom-length boards, the dedicated 3 to 11 letter Wordle solver pages use the same clue entry flow with the right answer bank for each length.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Why are there separate Dordle, Quordle, Octordle, and Canuckle solver pages?',
      answer: 'Each puzzle family now has its own dedicated solver route so users can land directly on the right interface, switch lengths where available, and move between related pages more easily.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use these solvers on my phone?',
      answer: 'Absolutely. All our solvers work great on mobile browsers. Just open this site on your phone, pick your solver, and enter your clues the same way you would on a computer.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Will using a solver ruin the fun?',
      answer: 'That depends on how you use it. Some people only use solvers when they\'re completely stuck on their last guess. Others use them to learn new words and improve their game. Think of it as a learning tool rather than a cheat sheet.'

      <h2 class="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50">What Puzzle Solvers Actually Do</h2>

      <p>
        A puzzle solver takes the partial information you've already figured out and uses it to find the answer faster than brute-force guessing. You tell the tool what you know — which letters are green, yellow, or gray in Wordle, for instance — and it filters through every possible answer, eliminating anything that conflicts with your clues. The remaining words get ranked by how commonly they appear in English, so the most likely answers show up first.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        The underlying math is straightforward. A standard 5-letter Wordle answer list contains around 2,300 words. After your first guess of "CRANE" with one green and two yellows, that list typically drops to somewhere between 50 and 150 candidates. After a second guess, it's usually under 10. The solver makes this filtering instant so you can focus on choosing which remaining word to try next rather than mentally checking hundreds of possibilities.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't cheating any more than using a calculator is cheating at math. The puzzle is still there, still solvable. The solver just handles the tedious part — the elimination — so you can spend your mental energy on the interesting part, which is picking the right next guess from a short, curated list.
      

      </p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50">Wordle Solvers: 3 Letters Through 11 Letters</h2>

      <p>
        The standard Wordle solver handles 5-letter words, but that's just the starting point. Wordle variants have popped up for nearly every word length, and each one needs its own word list. A 3-letter solver works with a completely different dictionary than an 11-letter solver — not just shorter words, but different words entirely.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        Each length-specific solver on this page uses the correct dictionary for that variant. The 3-letter solver uses the Thirdle word list. The 5-letter solver uses the official Wordle answer list. The 6-letter solver uses the Canuckle dictionary. The 8-letter solver works with the longer Wordle variant lists. This matters because using the wrong word list would suggest answers that aren't even valid guesses in the game you're playing.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        All the Wordle-length solvers share the same interface: enter a guess, mark each letter as correct (green), misplaced (yellow), or absent (gray), and watch the candidate list update in real time. The filtering runs entirely in your browser using WebAssembly, so there's no server delay. On a modern phone, filtering 2,300 words takes under 5 milliseconds.
      

      </p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50">Multi-Board Solvers: Quordle, Octordle, Dordle</h2>

      <p>
        Multi-board puzzles change the problem fundamentally. Instead of filtering one word list, the solver needs to find words that are valid across multiple boards simultaneously. A guess in Quordle applies to all four boards, so the ideal guess is one that makes progress on as many boards as possible.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Quordle solver lets you enter clues for all four boards on the same page. After entering a guess, you mark the colors for each board independently — board 1 might show green-gray-yellow-gray-green while board 2 shows all grays. The solver then finds words that are consistent with at least one board's constraints and ranks them by how many boards they help.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        Octordle follows the same pattern at eight boards. Dordle works with two. The shared-guess mechanic is what makes these puzzles interesting strategically, and the solver helps you think about it by showing exactly how many valid words remain on each board.
      

      </p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50">Non-Word Solvers: Nerdle, Colordle, Minesweeper</h2>

      <p>
        Not every puzzle is about letters. Nerdle is about equations. You enter your equation guess and mark each character as correct, misplaced, or absent — the same mechanic as Wordle but with digits and operators instead of letters. The Nerdle solver handles all five modes (Micro, Mini, Midi, Classic, Maxi) and validates that suggestions are mathematically correct equations.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        Colordle asks you to guess a color. The solver works with hex values and RGB feedback — if the game tells you you're "too red," the solver adjusts the candidate colors accordingly. It's a different type of filtering (numerical ranges instead of letter positions) but the same principle: constrain the possibilities until the answer is obvious.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        The Minesweeper solver takes a different approach entirely. Instead of filtering a list, it analyzes the board state to determine which cells are definitely safe and which are definitely mines. It uses constraint satisfaction — the numbers on revealed cells tell you exactly how many mines are adjacent, and the solver combines all these constraints to find logically deducible cells. When pure logic isn't enough, it calculates mine probability for each remaining cell.
      

      </p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50">Character Guessing Solvers</h2>

      <p>
        Games like LoLdle, Pokedle, and Smashdle give you attribute-based clues — release year, genre, element type, weight class — and you narrow down from hundreds or thousands of possible characters. These solvers work as attribute filters: you tell the tool "the character was released before 2015" or "the character is a fire type" and it eliminates every character that doesn't match.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        The effectiveness of these solvers depends on the data. Our Pokedle solver, for example, has type, generation, height, weight, and evolution stage for every Pokemon. The LoLdle solver has role, region, release year, gender, and resource type for every League champion. More data points mean faster elimination. After three or four well-chosen filters, you're typically down to under 10 candidates from a starting pool of 150+.
      

      </p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50">Word Ladder and Boggle Solvers</h2>

      <p>
        Word ladder puzzles (Weaver, Word Ladder Solver) ask you to transform one word into another by changing one letter at a time, with every intermediate step being a valid word. The solver uses a breadth-first search through a graph of words connected by single-letter differences. Finding the shortest path is a classic graph algorithm — simple in concept but computationally expensive when the word list is large, which is why the search runs in a Web Worker to keep the UI responsive.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        Boggle is a different beast entirely. Given a grid of letters, find every valid word that can be formed by a path of adjacent cells without reusing any cell. The solver builds a trie from the dictionary and walks every possible path on the board simultaneously. For a 5x5 grid, that's up to 12 million paths — the trie pruning is what makes it fast enough to run in real time.
      

      </p>
      <h2 class="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50">Tips for Using Solvers Effectively</h2>

      <p>
        The most common mistake people make with solvers is entering clues incorrectly. One wrong color mark can throw off the entire filter, producing a list that excludes the actual answer. Double-check each letter before submitting. If the solver says "zero words match your clues," you almost certainly marked something wrong.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, don't just pick the first word the solver suggests. Look at the top 5-10 suggestions and think about which one would give you the most information if it's wrong. Sometimes the second or third suggestion is strategically better than the first because it tests more unconfirmed letters.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        Third, use the solver as a learning tool. When you see words on the suggestion list that you've never heard of, look them up. "ADIEU" shows up constantly in Wordle solvers not because it's a common word but because it tests five vowels in one guess. Understanding why certain words rank highly teaches you patterns you can use without the solver.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, try to solve at least the first two guesses on your own before opening the solver. The early-game decisions are where most of the strategy lives.
